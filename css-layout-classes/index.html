          <h2>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h2>
          <p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate received universal acclaim from both
            critics and players, with some critics calling it the best installment
            in the series. It received praise for its large amount of content and
            fine-tuning of existing Smash gameplay elements, although its online
            mode was widely criticized.
